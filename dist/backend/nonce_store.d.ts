/**
 * backend/nonce_store.ts
 *
 * INonceStore — pluggable nonce-persistence interface for X402PaymentTool.
 *
 * Replay protection requires that used nonces survive process restarts and
 * are shared across horizontal scale-out instances.  This module provides:
 *
 *   • INonceStore — the injectable interface
 *   • SqliteNonceStore — the default implementation backed by the existing
 *     SQLite database (same DB_PATH used by persistence.ts)
 *   • InMemoryNonceStore — lightweight in-process store for unit tests
 *
 * For multi-instance deployments, inject a custom INonceStore backed by a
 * shared store (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB) via the X402PaymentTool constructor.
 *
 * Nonce TTL
 * ---------
 * X402 challenges carry an `expiresAt` field.  Once a challenge has expired
 * it can never be replayed legitimately, so nonces older than the configured
 * TTL can be pruned.  The TTL comes from `X402_NONCE_TTL_MS` and defaults to
 * 24 hours — well above the expected maximum challenge lifetime — so no valid
 * nonce is discarded prematurely.
 *
 * Eviction runs on every has()/add() call, so a long-running agent's store stays
 * bounded by the TTL window without any caller having to schedule pruning.
