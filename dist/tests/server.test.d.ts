/**
 * tests/server.test.ts
 *
 * Tests for backend/server.ts — the health-check HTTP server.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   - Mock `http.createServer` so we can capture the request handler
 *     without opening a real TCP port.
 *   - Mock `config` to provide deterministic values for STELLAR_NETWORK
 *     and AGENT_PUBLIC_KEY.
 *   - Mock `getResults` from persistence to inject controlled data for
 *     the /status endpoint.
 *   - Invoke the captured handler with mock req/res objects and assert
 *     the response shapes.
