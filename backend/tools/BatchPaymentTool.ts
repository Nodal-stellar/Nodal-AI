/**
 * backend/tools/BatchPaymentTool.ts
 *
 * Executes 1–100 payment operations in a single atomic Stellar transaction.
 * Spending limit is enforced on the aggregate amount (sum of all payments).
 *
 * Because the batch is one transaction, it either applies in full or not at
 * all — there is no partial application to unwind. `failFast` therefore governs
 * the pre-flight check that runs before anything is submitted: with it set, the
 * first unusable payment aborts the batch and the payments behind it are
 * reported as skipped; without it every payment is checked so the caller gets
 * the full list of problems in one round trip.
